	"description": "This is the layout I made, based on an NSX layout that was set up quite differently. It was made for my returnal theme but the hud was off center slightly in that so I changed it in my Last of Us 2 theme. It has only what I generally use in it. The shop and news icons were removed and also the user icons were removed. There is now an option to bring back user icons.",
