	"description": "A custom made settings layout that rearranges the settings tabs to the way I prefer. All lines I could find were removed and everything was moved to be the same distance apart. The child lock tab was removed but there is an option to unhide it. I recommend you to remove the entire footer using a custom common layout. That way you can make it look like in the image. You can find it on the Eternal Returnal or Banned layout page. Updated for 13.0 so the bluetooth section isn't in a random place at the bottom.",
