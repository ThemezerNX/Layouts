This repository holds all layouts and options available on the [Themezer.net](https://themezer.net/layouts) website. Layout options are small JSON files with patches for the original layout. This way people can customize a layout even more, directly on the website: no coding required!

## Submission Instructions

The instructions are available on [the wiki](../../wiki)

## Thanks To

Without layouts there wouldn't be so many awesome themes, therefore, I want to thank the awesome people who took the time to design these incredible menu layouts 🤝
